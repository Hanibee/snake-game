# snake-game
I made my snake game using javascript, html, and css, and had a lot of fun with styling it. 

One of the cool parts of my code is the recursive function. Basically what happens is the function calls itself and executes the function again, in the case of my game, it is to continue moving in a specific direction. The function keeps on looping until either a border is reached which means game is over, or direction is changed.
